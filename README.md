## About
AtoM to TARO XSLT Conversion, atom2taro, facilitates XML export from the Access to Memory (AtoM) Archival Management System to a compliant XML import into Texas Archival Resources Online (TARO) system. The stylesheet converts the DTD-based 2002 EAD XML export from AtoM and conforms the data to comply with TARO best practices and schema-based XML template.

Created by Sandra Yates, McGovern Historical Center, Texas Medical Center Library, July 14, 2021. The code is maintained and updated to address development changes in AtoM and/or TARO. Updates can be found at [github.com/sane8s/atom2taro](https://github.com/sane8s/atom2taro). Collaboration and recommendations are welcome. More details about the archival systems at [txarchives.org](https://txarchives.org/) and [accesstomemory.org](https://www.accesstomemory.org/).

The code is based on the dtd2schema.xsl EAD DTD to Schema XSLT Conversion Version 200701 Alpha. Editors: Stephen Yearl (Yale) and Daniel V. Pitti (Virginia).
There is also modified code from ead-schema-to-dtd.xsl, developed by Woodson Research Center, Fondren Library, Rice University, that converts <c> tags to <c##> hierarchy.
